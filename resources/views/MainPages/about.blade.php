									<h2>Best Features</h2>
<p>The camp ground features structures and facilities for paramilitary drills, accommodation rooms, lecture halls, open field for sports and assembly and many of such. There are military personnel who train Corpers on appropriate military ceremonial matching, sports, as well as Man-O-War physical drills. There is the large market operated by the locals popularly called "Mami Market" where all camp needs are sold, including food and drinks.</p>

									<h3>Writer's Review</h3>
									<p>It is said that Orientation Camp is the best part of NYSC, and it is somewhat true. Here, you meet people from all parts of the country and learn and accept local customs and different cultures, make new friends, build camaraderie and learn what to expect during your service year. All through your stay in the camp, except Sunday worship mornings, you will wear your all-white tees, shorts and shoes. You will be served meals thrice daily but most Corpers prefer eating at the Mami Market where the choice and quality of food is better. There is always an activity for each time of the day, with brief moments in the evening allowed for personal use. Go to camp with an open mind and a thirst for adventure and you will enjoy it to the fullest.</p>

									<h2>Katsina State NYSC Secretariat</h2>
									<p>This is the administrative office of the National Youth Service Corps in Katsina. It oversees the welfare, documentation and the general affairs of youth corpers in the state.</p>
									<p>Always come in your NYSC uniform or you won't be attended to</p>

									<h3>What To Bring</h3>
<p>Before heading to Katsina State NYSC Secretariat, here are some helpful things to take along with you:</p>

<ol>





										<li>All documents regarding NYSC including; Call-up letter, Registration documents, School's Certificate, Green Card and Student ID Card
										</li>
										<li>Your NYSC ID Card</li>
										
									</ol>

<h3>Best Features</h3>
<p>While there are secretariats in all local governments in the state, It is where to report to after your 21 days at the Orientation Camp to get assigned to your Place of Primary Assignment (PPA). Weekly Community Development Service (CDS) are also held here, along with the NYSC sponsored Skills Acquisition Entrepreneurship Development program. This is also where to go if you have inquiries about the NYSC scheme in Katsina State</p>


<h3>Writer's Review</h3>
<p>As long as you are fully kitted in your NYSC uniform, you have no fear of being turned away. Different people have different tales of how they interacted with the officials and staff but I have found that a smile, knowledge of the local language, and an appealing face helps for a positive interaction. It will be wise to befriend one of the staff as you never know when an inside-ear will be needed.</p>

<h3>Most common visitorsM.</h3>
<p>You will see a lot of Corps members, NYSC staff, SAED Instructors and hawkers here.</p>
