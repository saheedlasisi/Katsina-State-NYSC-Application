#{{$shop_auth_id}} ,
<font color="green">Shop created successfully. [{{$shop_name}}]</font>
<br>
But you are one step ahead to go........ 
<br>Maintainace fee of #500 has to be paid to the management in order to activate the shop you just created.
<br>Note Inactive Shop can only be seen by the creator not to other corps members on the platform.
<br>
And the maintainance fee is one time payment.


Thanks,<br>
